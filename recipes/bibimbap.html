    <h2>What is Bibimbap?</h2>
    <p>Korean bibimbap, along with kimchi, takes its place among the favored foods in Korean cuisine. Meaning mixed
        rice, bibimbap is a popular meal consisting of white rice topped with vegetables, beef, a whole egg, and
        gochujang (red chili pepper paste). You can substitute with soy sauce or Sriracha (rooster sauce) for those who
        cannot handle the spiciness, like our children.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 English cucumber, cut into matchsticks</li>
        <li>1/4 cup gochujang (Korean hot pepper paste) (optional)</li>
        <li>1 bunch fresh spinach, cut into thin strips</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons olive oil, divided</li>
        <li>2 carrots, cut into matchsticks</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 pinch red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>1 pound thinly-sliced beef top round steak</li>
        <li>4 large eggs</li>
        <li>4 cups cooked white rice</li>
        <li>4 teaspoons sesame seed</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons gochujang (Korean hot pepper paste)(optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Stir together cucumber pieces and gochujang paste in a bowl; set aside</li>
        <li>Bring about 2 cups water to a boil in a large nonstick skillet and stir in spinach; cook until bright green
            and wilted, 2 to 2 minutes. Drain spinach and squeeze out as much moisture as possible; set spinach aside a
            bowl and stir in soy sauce.</aside>
        </li>
        <li>Heat 1 teaspoon olive oil in a large nonstick skillet; cook and stir carrots until softened, about 3
            minutes. Stir in garlic and cook just until fragrant flakes. Set mixture aside in a bowl.</li>
        <li>Brown beef in a clean nonstick skillet over medium hear, about 5 minutes per side; set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat the remaining 1 teaspoon olive oil in another nonstick skillet over medium-low heat. Fry eggs just on
            one side until yolks are runny, but white are firm, 2 to 4 minutes.</li>
        <li>Divide cooked rice into 4 large serving bowls; top with spinach mixture, a few pieces of beef, and cucumber
            mixture. Place 1 egg atop each serving. Drizzle each bowl with 1 teaspoon sesame oil, a sprinkle of sesame
            seeds, and a small amount of gochujang paste if desired.</li>
    </ol>
