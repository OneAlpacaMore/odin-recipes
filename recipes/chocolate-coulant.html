    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>To prepare the chocolate coulant, we will start by putting the oven to heat to 180ºC, heat up and down.</li>
        <li>In a bowl we put the butter and chocolate, in another the eggs and sugar.</li>
        <li>We put the chocolate and butter in the microwave or we can melt it in a bain-marie, on the other hand we
            beat the sugar and eggs with the rods.</li>
        <li>We add the sifted flour and mix little by little.</li>
        <li>In this mixture we will put the chocolate that we have melted together with the butter and cocoa powder.

        <li>We prepare some molds and spread them with a little butter.</li>
        <li>We fill the molds filling them ¾ parts of their capacity, as they rise.</li>
        <li>We put the molds in the oven for 7 minutes, it will vary according to the oven, but to guide myself I look
            at the upper part of the coulant, when you see them without the chocolate shine they are ready. You have to
            be very aware of them.</li>
        <li>Once they are, you remove them from the oven, we remove them from the molds very carefully and serve hot.
        </li>
        <li>And ready to eat</li>
