    <h2>What is tomato soup?</h2>
    <p>Tomato soup is quintessential American comfort food, usually eaten with a grilled cheese sandwich.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 cups chopped fresh tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 slice onion</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic</li>
        <li>2 cups chicken broth</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons white sugar, or to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a stockpot, over medium heat, combine the tomatoes, large slice of onion, garlic cloves, and chicken
            broth. Bring to a boil, and gently boil for about 20 minutes to blend all of the flavors. Remove from heat
            and run the mixture through a food mill into a large bowl, or pan. Discard any stuff left over in the food
            mill.</li>
        <li>In the now empty stockpot, melt the butter over medium heat. Stir in the flour to make a roux, cooking until
            the roux is a medium brown. Gradually whisk in a bit of the tomato mixture, so that no lumps form, then stir
            in the rest. Season with sugar and salt, and adjust to taste.</li>
    </ol>
