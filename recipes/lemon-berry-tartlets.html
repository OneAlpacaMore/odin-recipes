    <h2>Lemon Berry Tartlets?</h2>
    <p>This recipe is more about the technique for making little puff pastry tart shells. Fill with lemon curd,
        chocolate mousse, or whipped cream.</p>
    <hr />
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 sheet frozen puff pastry</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon all-purpose flour for dusting</li>
        <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
        <li>â…“ cup lemon curd</li>
        <li>12 fresh blackberries</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon confectioners' sugar for dusting</li>
    </ul>
    <hr />
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking
            mat.</li>
        <li>Place frozen puff pastry sheet on a work surface dusted with flour. Allow to thaw for 2 to 3 minutes. Using
            a 1 1/2 to 2-inch round cookie or biscuit cutter, cut out 12 round pieces. Place pastry rounds on the
            prepared baking sheet. Using a slightly smaller round cookie or biscuit cutter, cut out inner circles in
            each pastry round, leaving them in place. Brush each pastry round with beaten egg.
        </li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until browned and puffed, 13 to 15 minutes. Allow to cool completely before
            filling.</li>
        <li>Cut around the small inner circle of each pastry round and gently push it down. Fill each tartlet with lemon
            curd and top with a blackberry. Dust with confectioners' sugar.</li>
    </ol>
